## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid (for body centering with `place-items`)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this project, I reinforced my knowledge of **CSS variables**, **flexbox for layout organization**, and using **grid centering (`place-items`)** for the card in the middle of the page.  

I also practiced creating consistent hover states for interactive elements.  

Example CSS I’m proud of:

```css
.social-link:hover {
    background-color: var(--Green);
    color: var(--Grey-900);
}
```


### Continued development

I’d like to continue focusing on:
- Improving responsive design techniques
- Practicing accessibility-friendly CSS (like focus states and color contrast)
- Experimenting with more advanced layout methods such as CSS clamp() and container queries

### Useful resources

-	MDN Web Docs - Always my go-to for CSS properties and layout explanations.
-	CSS Tricks - Helped me better understand flexbox and grid.
- Frontend Mentor Community - Helpful for seeing how others approached similar challenges.
